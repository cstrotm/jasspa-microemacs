meMsdev
=======

meMsdev is a Visual  Studio Add-In that allowd  MicroEmacs to be integrated as
the default text editor. It will be used instead of the Visual Studio built in
editor when you double click on a file or press F4.

Installation
============

1) Copy mesdev.dll into the MicroEmacs directory i.e.

    c:/Program Files/JASSPA/MicroEmacs

2) Edit  the  "me32.ini"  file in your  Windows  directory  and  identify  the
   location of the  MicroEmacs  executable.  The  excutatable  name is used to
   spawn MicroEmacs if it is not already running. The entry takes the form:-

    ; Identify the location of the MicroEmacs executable so that the
    ; Developer Studio "Add-In" can locate the executable
    [Location]
    exe=c:\Program Files\JASSPA\MicroEmacs\me32.exe

   Change the "exe" entry to match the location and name of your executable.

3) From a DOS box, register the DLL using regsvr32.exe i.e.

    > cd c:/Program Files/JASSPA/MicroEmacs
    > regsvr32 memsdev.dll

4) Start Visual Studio and goto:-

    Tools
        Customize...
            Add-Ins and Macro Files

5) Click on Browse and point Visual Studio to your "memsdev.dll" file.

6) Click the checkbox to indicate that you want to use the Add-In, and
   close the Customize dialog box.

7) You should notice the MicroEmacs toolbar showing the MicroEmacs Icon.
   This invokes a dialog that allows you to attach and detach MicroEmacs
   as the default editor.

Using "meMsdev"
===============

Clicking on the  MicroEmacs  Toolbar shows the meMsdev  configuration  dialog.
Check the boxes when  MicroEmacs edit session is required as default;  uncheck
the boxes if you wish to revert to the built-in dialog.

Use  Visual  Studio as normal,  and  MicroEmacs  should  almost  always  bring
MicroEmacs to the  foreground to edit the document. If a MicroEmacs is already
running then  "meMsdev"  will attach to an existing  session and will load the
file. If  MicroEmacs is not detected then a new version is spawed off and then
an attachment is made.

Running a Debug Session
=======================

meMsdev  does not  currently  provide  any  debugging  capability  (but we are
working  on it !!). To  start  debugging  it is  suggest  that the  Editor  is
uncoupled (MicroEmacs Dialogue -> Uncheck Boxes) and work within the Developer
studio.

When you have finished debugging and wish to move back to an edit session then
then re-enable  MicroEmacs  (MicroEmacs Dialogue -> Check Boxes) AND close any
windows     that     are    open     within     the     MS-Dev     environment
(Window->Windows...->Select  All  and  "Close  All  Windows").  Then  commence
editing again.

While  MicroEmacs  is  attached,   selecting  any  of  the  find  file  lines,
compilation  error lines etc within the response panes will take MicroEmacs to
the sepecified line.

Problems:

meMsdev  works by hooks  exposed by Visual  Studio. Most of the  functionality
works from the  OpenDocument  (look it up in VS 5) hook. So...If a document is
ALREADY  open in  Visual  Studio,  and you  double  click the file in the File
Browser...Emacs  will NOT come to the foreground.  Since the document was open
in the Visual Studio editor, the OpenDocument event never occurred.
