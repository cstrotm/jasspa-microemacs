PATCHING 
     This page describes  how to patch  a MicroEmacs installation  with a later
     release without re-installing. 

  Windows 
     Windows requires  careful patching  in order  not to  disturb the registry
     settings The following procedure should be followed. 

       *  Move to the jasspa directory, c:\ProgramFiles\JASSPA\Microemacs. 
       *  COPY the  executable me32.exe  to a  backup, you  MUST copy  the file
          otherwise the registry settings will change. DO NOT MOVE THE FILE. 

            copy me32.exe me32_2002_12.exe 

       *  Save the macros directory, these may be moved i.e. 

            rename macros macros_2002_12 

       *  Unpack and  install  the new  Windows  executable and  COPY  over the
          original executable that was previously backed up i.e. 

            copy c:\path-to-executable\me32-win32-20040108-rc1.exe me32.exe 

       *  Create a new  macros directory and  install the macros  into this new
          directory, do this manually or using a utility like WINZip. 

            mkdir macros 
            cd macros 
            unzip c:\path-to\memacros-20040108-rc1.zip 

       *  The  new  version  of  MicroEmacs  will  now  operate  with  the  old
          installation environment.  You  may  return  to  the  old  release by
          reversing the steps to patch the installation. 

  UNIX/Linux 
     For *NIX package installations then patching is a little easier. The steps
     are defined as follows:- 

       *  Move to the jasspa directory. 

            cd /opt/jasspa/bin 

       *  Save the original executable. 

            mv me me_200212 

       *  Unpack the new executable and make it executable. 

            gunzip me-sun-solaris-20040108-rc1.gz 
            mv me-sun-solaris-20040108-rc1 me 
            chmod a+x me 

       *  Save the existing macros directory. 

            cd /opt/jasspa 
            mv macros macros_200212 

       *  Create a new macros directory and install the new macros:- 

            mkdir macros 
            cd macros 
            unzip /path-to/memacros-20040108-rc1.zip 

       *  Installed packages  are built  with the  install path  built into the
          executable, this  may  be different  from  the patch  version  of the
          executable  so  the  environment  variable  $MEINSTALLPATH(5)  may be
          defined in the environment with the macro installation search paths.
