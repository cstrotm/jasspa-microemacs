/*
 * Created:     Thu Jan 15 1998
 * Synopsis:    Definition of the modes.
 * Authors:     Steve Philips
 * Description:
 *      Included by emode.h to create an ordered list of global/buffer modes.
 *
 * Notes:
 *      The modes were originally defined in edef.h.
 *      The list MUST be ordered for the message-line auto-complete to work.
